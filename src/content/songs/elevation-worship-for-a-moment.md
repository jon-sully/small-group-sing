## Verse 1

Peace be still you are with me

In this hope I abide

Jesus be my sustainer

Strengthen me in this trial

```
1 5 4 -
2 6 5 -
```



## Chorus

And I know, it's only for a moment

And everything is working for your glory

But I need, your perfect love to hold me

Safe within your promise

Til the storm has passed

```
1 5 6 4
2 6 1/3 5
```



## Verse 2

When this burden is lifted

I'll give thanks to your name

But until it is finished

I'll give praise just the same

## Bridge

For we have this hope

As an anchor for our soul

You are with us

We will never be alone

```
