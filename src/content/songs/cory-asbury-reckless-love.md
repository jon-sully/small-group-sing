## Verse 1

Before I spoke a word, You were singin## over me

You have been so, so ## ood to me

Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me

You have been so, so kind to me

## Chorus

Oh the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God

Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine

I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it Still, You give yourself away

Oh, the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God

## Verse 2

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me

You have been so, so good to me

When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me

You have been so, so kind to me

## Chorus

And oh the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God

Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine

I couldn't earn it and I don't deserve it Still, You give yourself away

Oh the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God

## Bridge (x2)

There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, comin' after me

There's no wall You won't kick down, lie You won't tear down, comin' after me

There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, comin' after me

There's no wall You won't kick down, lie You won't tear down, comin' after me

## Chorus (x2)

Oh the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God

Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety nine

I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it Still, You give yourself away

Oh the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God

## Outro

I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it Still, You give yourself away

Oh the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God
