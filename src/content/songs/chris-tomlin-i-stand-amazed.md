## Verse 1

I stand amazed in the presence

Of Jesus the Nazarene

And wonder how He could love me

A sinner, condemned, unclean

## Chorus

O how marvelous! O how wonderful!

And my song shall ever be:

O how marvelous! O how wonderful!

Is my Savior's love for me!

## Verse 2

He took my sins and my sorrows

He made them His very own;

He bore the burden to Calvary

And suffered and died alone

## Chorus

O how marvelous! O how wonderful!

And my song shall ever be:

O how marvelous! O how wonderful!

Is my Savior's love for me!

## Verse 3

When with the ransomed in glory

His face I at last shall see

'Twill be my joy through the ages

To sing of His love for me

## Chorus

O how marvelous! O how wonderful!

And my song shall ever be:

O how marvelous! O how wonderful!

Is my Savior's love for me!
