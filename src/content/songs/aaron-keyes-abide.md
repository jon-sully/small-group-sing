## Verse 1

For my waking breath for my daily bread

I depend on You, I depend on You

For the sun to rise for my sleep at night

I depend on You, I depend on You

## Chorus 1

You're the way the truth and the life

You're the well that never runs dry

I'm the branch and You are the vine

Draw me close and teach me to abide

## Verse 2

Where the Spirit leads as I'm following

I depend on You, I depend on You

For the victories still in front of me

I depend on You, I depend on You

## Chorus 2

You're the way the truth and the life

You're the well that never runs dry

I'm the branch and You are the vine

Draw me close and teach me to abide

Be my strength my song in the night

Be my all my treasure my prize

I am Yours forever Your mine

Draw me close and teach me to abide

## Verse 3

When I pass through death as I enter rest

I depend on You, I depend on You

For eternal life to be raised with Christ

I depend on You, I depend on You

## Chorus 2

You're the way the truth and the life

You're the well that never runs dry

I'm the branch and You are the vine

Draw me close and teach me to abide

Be my strength my song in the night

Be my all my treasure my prize

I am Yours forever Your mine

Draw me close and teach me to abide

Yes, I depend on You, I depend on You
