## Verse 1

Christ is my firm foundation

The rock on which I stand

When everything around me is shaken

I've never been more glad

That I put my faith in Jesus

'Cause He's never let me down

He's faithful through generations

So why would He fail now

He won't, He won't

## Verse 2

I've still got joy in chaos

I've got peace that makes no sense

I won't be going under

I'm not held by my own strength

'Cause I've built my life on Jesus

He's never let me down

He's faithful in every season

So why would He fail now

## Chorus

He won't, He won't

He won't fail

He won't fail

## Verse 1

Christ is my firm foundation

The rock on which I stand

When everything around me is shaken

I've never been more glad

That I put my faith in Jesus

'Cause He's never let me down

He's faithful through generations

So why would He fail now

He won't, He won't

## Chorus

He won't, He won't

He won't fail

He won't fail

## Bridge (x3)

Rain came and wind blew

But my house was built on You

I'm safe with You

I'm going to make it through

## Tag (x2)

Yeah, I'm going to make it through

'Cause I'm standing strong on You

## Verse 1

Christ is my firm foundation

The rock on which I stand

So why would He fail now

He won't, He won't

## Chorus

He won't, He won't

He won't fail

He won't fail
