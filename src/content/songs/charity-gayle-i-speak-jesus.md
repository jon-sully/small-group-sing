## Verse 1

I just want to speak the name of Jesus

Over every heart and every mind

'Cause I know there is peace within Your presence

I speak Jesus

## Verse 2

I just want to speak the name of Jesus

'Til every dark addiction starts to break

Declaring there is hope and there is freedom

I speak Jesus

## Chorus

Your name is power

Your name is healing

Your name is life

Break every stronghold

Shine through the shadows

Burn like a fire

## Verse 3

I just want to speak the name of Jesus

Over fear and all anxiety

To every soul held captive by depression

I speak Jesus

## Chorus (x2)

'Cause Your name is power

Your name is healing

Your name is life

Break every stronghold

Shine through the shadows

Burn like a fire

## Bridge (x2)

Shout Jesus from the mountains, Jesus in the streets

Jesus in the darkness over every enemy

And Jesus for my family

I speak the holy name, Jesus

## Chorus (x2)

Your name is power

Your name is healing

Your name is life

Break every stronghold

Shine through the shadows

Burn like a fire

## Verse 1

I just want to speak the name of Jesus

Over every heart and every mind

'Cause I know there is peace within Your presence

I speak Jesus

## Bridge

Shout Jesus from the mountains, Jesus in the streets

Jesus in the darkness over every enemy

And Jesus for my family

I speak the holy name, Jesus
