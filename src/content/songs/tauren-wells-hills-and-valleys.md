## Verse 1

I've walked among the shadows, You wiped my tears away

And I've felt the pain of heartbreak, And I've seen the brighter days

And I've prayed prayers to heaven, From my lowest place

And I have held Your blessings, God, You give and take away

## PC

No matter what I have, Your grace is enough

No matter where I am, I'm standing in Your love

```

## Chorus

On the mountains I will bow my life, to the One who set me there

In the valley I will lift my eyes, to the One who sees me there

When I'm standing on the mountain, I didn't get there on my own

When I'm walking through the valley, I know I am not alone

You're God of the hills and valleys, hills and valleys

God of the hills and valleys, and I am not alone (I am not alone)

```

## Verse 2

I've watched my dreams get broken. In You, I hope again

No matter what I know I'm safe inside Your hands

## Chorus

On the mountains I will bow my life, to the One who set me there

In the valley I will lift my eyes, to the One who sees me there

When I'm standing on the mountain, I didn't get there on my own

When I'm walking through the valley, I know I am not alone

You're God of the hills and valleys, hills and valleys

God of the hills and valleys, and I am not alone (I am not alone)
