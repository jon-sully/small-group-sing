## Verse 1

How deep the Father's love for us,

how vast beyond all measure

that He should give His only Son

to make a wretch His treasure.

How great the pain of searing loss.

The Father turns His face away

as wounds which mar the Chosen One

bring many sons to glory.

## Verse 2

Behold the Man upon the cross,

my sin upon His shoulders.

Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice

call out among the scoffers.

It was my sin that held Him there

until it was accomplished;

His dying breath has brought me life.

I know that it is finished.

## Verse 3

I will not boast in anything:

no gifts, no pow'r, no wisdom.

But I will boast in Jesus Christ:

His death and resurrection.

Why should I gain from His reward?

I cannot give an answer.

But this I know with all my heart:

His wounds have paid my ransom.
