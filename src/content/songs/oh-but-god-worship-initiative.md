## Verse 1

I was buried beneath my rebellion

Lost without hope of redemption

Blind in my need for a Savior

Oh but God

## Verse 2

Crushed by the weight of my failure

Living the lie I created

Digging my grave without knowing

Oh but God oh but God

## Chorus

Rich in mercy how You loved me

Too much to let me stay lost

My salvation sent from heaven

Nailing my sin to a cross

Oh but God

## Verse 3

You gave me a truth worth believing

And I traded my chains for Your freedom

Cause You were the one that I needed

Oh but God

## Verse 4

Resurrecting my heart from the ruins

My rescue came through like the morning

Now this is my sure testimony

Oh but God oh but God

## Chorus 

Rich in mercy how You loved me

Too much to let me stay lost

My salvation sent from heaven

Nailing my sin to a cross

Oh but God

## Bridge (x2)

All the wreckage of my choices

You have turned to life from ashes

Lifted from death risen with Him

Now I stand in confidence

## Chorus (x2)

Rich in mercy how You loved me

Too much to let me stay lost

My salvation sent from heaven

Nailing my sin to a cross Oh

## Outro (x4)

Oh but God
