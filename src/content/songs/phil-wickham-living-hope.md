## Verse 1

How great the chasm that lay between us

How high the mountain I could not climb

In desperation I turned to heaven

And spoke Your name into the night

Then through the darkness Your loving kindness

Tore through the shadows of my soul

The work is finished, the end is written

Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

## Verse 2

Who could imagine so great a mercy

What heart could fathom such boundless grace

The God of ages stepped down from glory

To wear my sin and bear my shame

The cross has spoken, I am forgiven

The King of Kings calls me His own

Beautiful Savior I’m Yours forever

Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

## Chorus

Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free

Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me

You have broken every chain, there’s salvation in Your Name

Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

## Verse 3

Then came the morning that sealed the promise

Your buried body began to breathe

Out of the silence the roaring Lion

Declared the grave has no claim on me

## Verse 3b

Then came the morning that sealed the promise

Your buried body began to breathe

Out of the silence the roaring Lion

Declared the grave has no claim on me

Jesus, Yours is the victory

## Chorus

Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free

Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me

You have broken every chain, there’s salvation in Your Name

Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

## Chorus 2

Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free

Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me

You have broken every chain, there’s salvation in Your Name

Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

Oh God, You are my Living Hope
