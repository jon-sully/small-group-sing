## Verse

I need You

To soften my heart and break me apart

I need You

To open my eyes, to see that You're shaping my life

```

All I am, I surrender

```

## Chorus

Give me faith to trust what You say

That You're good and Your love is great

I'm broken inside, I give You my life

```

To pierce through the dark and cleanse every part of me

All I am, I surrender

I may be weak but Your Spirit's strong in me

My flesh may fail, but my God, You never will
