## Verse 1

You embodied the fullness of God

Wrapped in mercy, You showed us Your heart

Your love upon the cross

Your love poured out for all

## Chorus

There is no one like the Lord our God

You've been faithful every day of my life

I could search the world and never find

Another like You, another like You

## Verse 2

You set a table, You invite us to come

Your body broken, Your blood was enough

This love upon the cross

This love poured out for all

## Chorus (x2)

There is no one like the Lord our God

You've been faithful every day of my life

I could search the world and never find

Another like You, another like You

## Bridge

Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the King

Worthy is the One who reigns forever

Seated on the throne, high above it all

Everyone will know You're like no other
