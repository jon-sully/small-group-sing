## Verse 1

I've carried a burden

For too long on my own

I wasn't created

To bear it alone

I hear your invitation

To let it all go

I see it now, I'm laying it down

And I know that I need you

## Chorus

I run to the Father, I fall into grace

I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait

My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend

So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

## Verse 2

You saw my condition,

Had a plan from the start

Your Son for redemption,

The price for my heart

And I don't have a context

For that kind of love

I don't understand, I can't comprehend

All I know is I need You

## Chorus

I run to the Father, I fall into grace

I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait

My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend

So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

## Bridge

My heart has been in Your sights

Long before my first breath

Running into Your arms

Is running to life from death

And I feel this rush deep in my chest

Your mercy is calling out

Just as I am You pull me in

And I know I need You now

## Chorus

I run to the Father, I fall into grace

I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait

My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend

So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

## Final Chorus

I run to the Father, I fall into grace

I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait

My heart found a surgeon, my soul found a friend

So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
