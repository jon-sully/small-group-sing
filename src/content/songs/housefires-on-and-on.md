## Verse 1

Where can I run from Your presence?

Where can I flee from You?

Even if I hide on the highest mountain

You are there

## Verse 2

Where can I run from Your presence?

Where can I flee from You?

Even if I lie in the lowest valley

You will find me there

## Chorus

Deeper than any ocean

Your love goes on and on and on and on

Higher than any mountain

Your love goes on and on and on and on

Your love goes on and on and on and on

## Verse 3

And if I clothe myself in shadow

Would I fade away from You?

No, even if I fall to the deepest darkness

Love surrounds me still

No, even if I fall to the deepest darkness

Your love surrounds me still

Deeper than any ocean

Your love goes on and on and on and on

Higher than any mountain

Your love goes on and on and on and on

Your love goes on and on and on and on

## Bridge 1 (x2)

There is no ending to Your

Love that holds on and won't let go

Love that won't leave me on my own

I'm falling deeper into Your

Love that holds on and won't let go

Love that won't leave me on my own

Your love goes on and on and on and on

There's nowhere I could run

There's nowhere I could hide

There's nowhere I could go that You won't find me, Lord

Love, don't let me go, don't let go
