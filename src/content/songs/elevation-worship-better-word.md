## Verse 1

What can wash away the guilty stain

After all the wrong I've done?

I've already tried a thousand ways

But it's never been enough

What could be enough?

```
1 5 6 [5 4]
```



## Chorus

Nothing but the blood

A better word was spoken

Oh, I know it was

Nothing but the blood

Every curse was broken

Oh, I know it was

Nothing but the blood

Nothing but the blood

```
1 5 6 4

## Verse 2

And when I'm reminded of my pain

To the fountain I will run

Every failure covered now in grace

For the Lamb has overcome

## Bridge

On that cross, hallelujah

I left my shame where the nails were

Jesus Christ, O Lamb of God

Be lifted higher forever

On that cross, hallelujah

I left my shame where the nails were

Jesus Christ, O Lamb of God

Be lifted higher forever

```
