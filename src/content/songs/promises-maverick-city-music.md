## Verse 1

God of Abraham

You're the God of covenant

And of faithful promises

Time and time again

You have proven

You'll do just what You said

## Pre-Chorus

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow

I'll remain steadfast

And let my heart learn, when You speak a word

It will come to pass

## Chorus

Great is Your faithfulness to me

Great is Your faithfulness to me

From the rising sun to the setting same

I will praise Your name

Great is Your faithfulness to me

## Verse 2

God from age to age

Though the earth may pass away

Your word remains the same

Your history can prove

There's nothing You can't do

You're faithful and true

## Pre-Chorus

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow

I'll remain steadfast

And let my heart learn, when You speak a word

It will come to pass

## Chorus (x2)

Great is Your faithfulness to me, oh

Great is Your faithfulness

From the rising sun

From the rising sun to the setting same

I will praise Your name

Great is Your faithfulness to me

## Bridge (x2)

I put my faith in Jesus

My anchor to the ground

My hope and firm foundation

He'll never let me down, no

## Chorus (x2)

Great is Your faithfulness to me

Great is Your faithfulness to me

From the rising sun to the setting same

I will praise Your name

Great is Your faithfulness to me
