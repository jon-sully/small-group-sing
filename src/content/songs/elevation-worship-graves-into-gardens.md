## Verse 1

I searched the world,

But it couldn’t fill me,

Man’s empty praise and treasures that fade,

Are never enough.

## Verse 2

Then You came along,

And put me back together,

Every desire is now satisfied,

Here in Your love.

## Chorus

Oh there’s nothing better than You,

There’s nothing better than You,

Lord, there’s nothing,

Nothing is better than You,

## Verse 3

I’m not afraid,

To show You my weakness,

My failures and flaws, Lord You’ve seen them all,

And You still call me friend.

## Verse 4

‘Cause the God of the mountain,

Is the God of the valley,

There’s not a place Your mercy and grace,

Won’t find me again.

## Chorus (x2)

Oh there’s nothing better than You,

There’s nothing better than You,

Lord, there’s nothing,

Nothing is better than You.

## Bridge 1

You turn mourning to dancing,

You give beauty for ashes,

You turn shame into glory,

You’re the only one who can.

## Bridge 2

You turn graves into gardens,

You turn bones into armies,

You turn seas into highways,

You’re the only one who can.

You’re the only one who can

## Chorus (x2)

Oh there’s nothing better than You,

There’s nothing better than You,

Lord, there’s nothing,

Nothing is better than You.

## Bridge 2 (x2)

You turn graves into gardens,

You turn bones into armies,

You turn seas into highways,

You’re the only one who can.
