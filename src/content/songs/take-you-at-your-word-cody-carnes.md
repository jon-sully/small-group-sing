## Verse 1

Your word is a lamp unto my feet

Your way is the only way for me

It's a narrow road that leads to life

But I wanna be on it

It's a narrow road but the mercy's wide

'Cause You're good on Your promise

## Chorus

I'll take You at Your word

If You said it, I'll believe it

I've seen how good it works

If You start it, You'll complete it

I'll take You at Your word

## Verse 2

You spoke and the chaos fell in line

Oh, I know 'cause I've seen it in my life

It's a narrow road that leads to life

But I wanna be on it, yeah

It's a narrow road and the tide is high

But You parted the water

## Chorus (x2)

I'll take You at Your word

If You said it, I'll believe it

I've seen how good it works

If You start it, You'll complete it

## Bridge (x2)

You said Your love will never give up

You said Your grace is always enough

You said Your heart would never forget or forsake me

Oh, You said I'm saved, You call me Yours

You said my future's full of Your hope

You've never failed so I know that You'll never fail me

## Chorus (x3)

I'll take You at Your word

If You said it, I'll believe it

I've seen how good it works

If You start it, You'll complete it

I'll take You at Your word
