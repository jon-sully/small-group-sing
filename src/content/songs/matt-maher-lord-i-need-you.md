## Verse 1

Lord, I come, I confess

Bowing here, I find my rest

Without You, I fall apart

You're the One that guides my heart

```
1 [4-1] 6 4
```

## Chorus

Lord, I need You, oh, I need You

Every hour I need You

My one defense, my righteousness

Oh God, how I need You

```

6 4 1 5
3 4 1 4

## Verse 2

Where pain runs deep, Your grace is more

Where grace is found is where You are

And where You are, Lord, I am free

Holiness is Christ in me

## Chorus

Lord, I need You, oh, I need You

Every hour I need You

My one defense, my righteousness

Oh God, how I need You
