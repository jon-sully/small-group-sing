## Verse 1

Beneath the surface

Of my anxious imagination

Beckons a calmness

That is found in You alone

It washes over

Every doubt, every imperfection

Jesus, Your presence

Is the comfort of my soul

## Chorus

There's nowhere I'd rather be

When You're singing over me

I just wanna be here with You

I'm lost in Your mystery

I'm found in Your love for me

I just wanna be here with You

```

## Verse 2

Here in the waiting

I won't worry about tomorrow

No need to focus

On the things I can't control

All my attention

On the wonder of this moment

Jesus, Your presence

Is the comfort of my soul

```

## Bridge

So let all that I am

Be consumed with who You are

Oh, the glory of Your presence

What more could I ask for?

So let all that I am

Be consumed with who You are

Oh, the glory of Your presence

What more could I ask for?

So let all that I am

Be consumed with who You are

Oh, the glory of Your presence

What more could I ask for?
