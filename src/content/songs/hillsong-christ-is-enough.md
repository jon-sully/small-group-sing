## Verse 1

Christ is my reward

And all of my devotion

Now there's nothing in this world

That could ever satisfy

## Prechorus 1

Through every trial

My soul will sing

No turning back

I've been set free

## Chorus

Christ is enough for me

Christ is enough for me

Everything I need is in You

Everything I need

## Verse 2

Christ my all in all

The joy of my salvation

And this hope will never fail

Heaven is our home

## Prechorus 2

Through every storm

My soul will sing

Jesus is here

To God be the glory

## Chorus

Christ is enough for me

Christ is enough for me

Everything I need is in You

Everything I need
