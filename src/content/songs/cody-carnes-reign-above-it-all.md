## Verse 1

The reign of darkness now has ended

In the kingdom of light

In the kingdom of light

Forever under Your dominion

You're the King of my life

You're the King of my life

## Chorus

You reign above it all

You reign above it all

Over the universe

And over every heart

There is no higher name

Jesus You reign above it all

## Verse 2

On the cross the work was finished

God You poured out Your life

Just to give us new life

Now from the lips of the forgiven

Hear an anthem arise

'Cause Jesus You're alive

## Chorus

You reign above it all

You reign above it all

Over the universe

And over every heart

There is no higher name

Jesus You reign above it all

## Bridge

You sent the darkness running

Out of an empty grave

Now seated alone in glory

Enthroned on the highest praise

## Chorus

Let all of heaven and the earth erupt in song

Sing hallelujah to the Everlasting One

There is no higher name

Jesus You reign above it all

You reign above it all
