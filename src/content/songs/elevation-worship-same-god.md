## Verse 1

I'm calling on the God of Jacob

Whose love endures through generations

I know that You will keep Your covenant

I'm calling on the God of Moses

The One who opened up the ocean

I need You now to do the same thing for me

## Chorus

O God, my God, I need You

O God, my God, I need You now

How I need You now

O Rock, O Rock of Ages

I'm standing on Your faithfulness

On Your faithfulness

## Verse 2

I'm calling on the God of Mary

Whose favor rests upon the lowly

I know with You all things are possible

I'm calling on the God of David

Who made a shepherd boy courageous

I may not face Goliath

but I've got my own giants

## Chorus

O God, my God, I need You

O God, my God, I need You now

How I need You now

O Rock, O Rock of Ages

I'm standing on Your faithfulness

On Your faithfulness

## Bridge

You heard Your children then

You hear Your children now

You are the same God

You are the same God

You answered prayers back then

And You will answer now

You are the same God

You are the same God

You were providing then

You are providing now

You are the same God

You are the same God

You moved in power then

God, move in power now

You are the same God

You are the same God

You were a healer then

You are a healer now

You are the same God

You are the same God

You were a Savior then

You are a Savior now

You are the same God

You are the same God

## Chorus (x2)

O God, my God, I need You

O God, my God, I need You now

How I need You now

O Rock, O Rock of Ages

I'm standing on Your faithfulness

On Your faithfulness

## Bridge 2

You freed the captives then

You're freeing hearts right now

You are the same God

You are the same God

You touched the lepers then

I feel Your touch right now

You are the same God

You are the same God

## Verse 3

I'm calling on the Holy Spirit

Almighty river, come and fill me a-gain

Come and fill me a-gain

Come and fill me a-gain
